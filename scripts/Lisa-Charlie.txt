Lisa has just finished a hard day at work and is looking for a way to unwind.

She opens up the Zeal app on her mobile phone to find something to do.  
The home screen features her top 10 suggestions followed by her favorite categories.  
These suggestions are made based on Lisa's preferences and context-sensitive data such as time of day, GPS location, 
and the number of Lisa's friends in the area.

She notices that 3 of her friends are at the Broadway Bar and, on top of that, there's a deal!

She clicks on it which brings her to the detailed description of the Broadway Bar deal.

Lisa purchases the deal and joins her friends at the Broadway Bar for a fun-filled night.

But Lisa isn't the only person Zeal has helped tonight... 

Meet Charlie. Charlie owns the Broadway Bar and has been struggling to make ends meet,
So he worked with NY Deals to set up a 50% off coupon in hopes of enticing new customers.
 
NY Deals offers all their deals through Zeal to increase exposure. Which helps small business owners, like Charlie, reach a larger audience.

Thanks to Zeal Deals, the Broadway Bar is havi`1 year!
