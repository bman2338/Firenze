Dan is an undergradate at Cornell University.
He is an avid foodie and would love to find a group of friends who enjoy the finer side of dining.

He knows that he has free time every Saturday evening to try new restaurants, 
but he doesn't know how to find new restaurants that he would enjoy.

So Dan turns to the internet for help.

A search on BING brings him to ZEAL where several different fine dining events are listed for the Ithaca area.

One of the events catches his eye.
He examines the event details and decides that he'd like to attend, so he adds the event to his Zeal schedule.
Since it is his first time using Zeal he is prompted to log in through facebook or to create a new account.

Dan logs in with his facebook account and is taken to the event page for the dining event that he just added.
This page allows users to have discussions about the event and organize invitations and atendees.

Now that Dan has singed up for the event, it is synced to his favorite calendar app.

Two days after his scheduled event, Dan gets an email from ZEAL prompting with a link to rate the event.
ZEAL uses these ratings to improve future event suggestions.
